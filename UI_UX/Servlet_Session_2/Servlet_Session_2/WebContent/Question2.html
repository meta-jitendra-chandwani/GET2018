            HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data
            types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like , although some
            represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example . The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and
            the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). Another important component is
            the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering. The following is an example of the
            classic "Hello, World!" program: The text between and describes the web page, and the text between and is the
            visible page content. The markup text This is a title defines the browser page title. The Document Type Declaration
            <!DOCTYPE html> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.
